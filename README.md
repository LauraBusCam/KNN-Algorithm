# KNN-Algorithm
This repository contains the implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch, using only the knowledge acquired during the Programming Logic II module of the Data Science training at Ada Tech. KNN is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm often used for classification and regression tasks.
